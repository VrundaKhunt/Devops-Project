Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information. This issue has been patched in version 2.31.0.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-32681","epss":0.06278,"percentile":0.90559,"date":"2025-12-05"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-32681","cwe":"CWE-200","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"requests","version":"2.19.1"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-j8r2-6x86-q33q","versionConstraint":">=2.3.0,<2.31.0 (python)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.31.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"46f8aaf5ced44b53","name":"requests","version":"2.19.1","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/requests-2.19.1.dist-info/METADATA","layerID":"sha256:9627a89d52c5444bbb39aeb17636270c9a649f927b6cd13c53420e744e2dca3e","accessPath":"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/requests-2.19.1.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/requests-2.19.1.dist-info/RECORD","layerID":"sha256:9627a89d52c5444bbb39aeb17636270c9a649f927b6cd13c53420e744e2dca3e","accessPath":"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/requests-2.19.1.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/requests-2.19.1.dist-info/top_level.txt","layerID":"sha256:9627a89d52c5444bbb39aeb17636270c9a649f927b6cd13c53420e744e2dca3e","accessPath":"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/requests-2.19.1.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["Apache 2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:requests:2.19.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/requests@2.19.1","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-56433","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-56433","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"shadow-utils (aka shadow) 4.4 through 4.17.0 establishes a default /etc/subuid behavior (e.g., uid 100000 through 165535 for the first user account) that can realistically conflict with the uids of users defined on locally administered networks, potentially leading to account takeover, e.g., by leveraging newuidmap for access to an NFS home directory (or same-host resources in the case of remote logins by these local network users).

is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.\n\n1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.\n2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`\n3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.\n4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).\n5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.\n\nThis happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified.

is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected. However, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects. Because this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident. Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach. We believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited: 1. Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support. 2. Not disabling HTTP redirects. 3. Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin. Users are advised to update to either version 1.26.19 or version 2.2.2. Users unable to upgrade may use the `Proxy-Authorization` header with urllib3's `ProxyManager`, disable HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests, or not user the `Proxy-Authorization` header as mitigations.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":0.8,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-37891","epss":0.00213,"percentile":0.43814,"date":"2025-12-05"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-37891","cwe":"CWE-669","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"urllib3","version":"1.23"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-34jh-p97f-mpxf","versionConstraint":"<1.26.19

Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle 301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45803","epss":0.00051,"percentile":0.15792,"date":"2025-12-05"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45803","cwe":"CWE-200","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"urllib3","version":"1.23"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-g4mx-q9vg-27p4","versionConstraint":">=0,<1.26.18 (python)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.26.18"}}],"artifact":{"id":"d727f075052feb89","name":"urllib3","version":"1.23","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/urllib3-1.23.dist-info/METADATA","layerID":"sha256:9627a89d52c5444bbb39aeb17636270c9a649f927b6cd13c53420e744e2dca3e","accessPath":"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/urllib3-1.23.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/urllib3-1.23.dist-info/RECORD","layerID":"sha256:9627a89d52c5444bbb39aeb17636270c9a649f927b6cd13c53420e744e2dca3e","accessPath":"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/urllib3-1.23.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/urllib3-1.23.dist-info/top_level.txt","layerID":"sha256:9627a89d52c5444bbb39aeb17636270c9a649f927b6cd13c53420e744e2dca3e","accessPath":"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/urllib3-1.23.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:urllib3:1.23:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/urllib3@1.23","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-12084","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-12084","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/027f21e417b26eed4505ac2db101a4352b7c51a0","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/08d8e18ad81cd45bc4a27d6da478b51ea49486e4","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/ddcd2acd85d891a53e281c773b3093f9db953964","https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/142145","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/142146"],"description":"When building nested elements using xml.dom.minidom methods such as appendChild() that have a dependency on _clear_id_cache() the algorithm is quadratic.

Starting in version 1.0 and prior to 2.6.0, the Streaming API improperly handles highly compressed data. urllib3's streaming API is designed for the efficient handling of large HTTP responses by reading the content in chunks, rather than loading the entire response body into memory at once. When streaming a compressed response, urllib3 can perform decoding or decompression based on the HTTP Content-Encoding header (e.g., gzip, deflate, br, or zstd). The library must read compressed data from the network and decompress it until the requested chunk size is met. Any resulting decompressed data that exceeds the requested amount is held in an internal buffer for the next read operation. The decompression logic could cause urllib3 to fully decode a small amount of highly compressed data in a single operation.
